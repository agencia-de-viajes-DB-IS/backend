Design Of AereoSkull's Database:

To Do:
	✅️ basic my-sql code to implement it.	
		- index to reference foreign key date type.
	✅️ fill basic implementation with garbage values.
		- did it using mockaroo.
	❌️ use entity framework to handle business rules at c# level.

Business Rules:
	1 - excursion has more than one day if it has associated hotels. // this has to be handled at the insertion level.
	2 - implement agency works with constraints.
